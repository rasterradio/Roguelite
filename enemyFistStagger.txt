;He kicks his feet backward, spraying sand in your direction.;He chokes for help, pulling on your hair in vain.;Oh Jesus.;He pulls his hands to his chest, coughing and wheezing.;He fumbles for your gun but his palms and fingers are slick with blood.;Under the moonlight, his emanciated body has been ravaged by thirst and hunger.;;He pulls his arms behind his head, as if he's not listening.;;;
