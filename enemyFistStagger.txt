He knocks you in the mouth and grins.;Feigning a stumble, he gets in close and strikes you in the kidneys.;He socks you in the ear. Your entire body rings.;The punch stings, but he felt it more than you. The movement causes him to yelp with pain.
He moves in close, uppercutting your jaw. Your teeth chatter.;He pulls you to the ground, slamming your head down with his hands.;He pushes himself against you, knocking you both against the wall. Your head hits it first.;He groans and tries to swing. The impact hurts, and the intertia makes him stumble.
He stomps on your foot and elbows your face. You stumble backwards.;He knees you in the gut. You bastard.;He recovers and hooks you twice in the stomach. You can't stop coughing.;He kicks and you both fall backwards in pain.
