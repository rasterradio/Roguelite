You start to run but he's fast.In a moment you're on the ground, kicking him back.;He clutches his nose and steps back. Hijo de puta. You'll pay for this.;You run. He spits, and stumbles forward as he rises, but doesn't follow.;He moans and gurgles, but doesn't dare move. You leave.
Coughing, you take a few steps back. He moves closer.;The both of you try to sidestep around the other. There's no escape.;You leave. He yells. Joder, pigfucker. But he doesn't follow.;He moans and gurgles, but doesn't dare move. You leave.
You try to hobble away, leaning against a wall for support. He punches your back in return and you fall.;He's hurt, but you're worse. Cobarde, he yells, pulling you back.;Crying in pain, you take a moment to breathe and he limps over.;You limp off. He screams in pain.
You fall to your knees and start to crawl. He withdraws a revolver.;No vamos a ninguna parte. He runs forward and kicks you in the gut, knocking the wind out of you.;You try to walk but have to catch yourself from falling. He kicks you onto your back.;You try to run but fall to your knees. He cries in pain, but keeps pace.
