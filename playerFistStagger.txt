You dash in and hook his nose. You feel a satisfying crunch.;You strike him in the chest. He takes a step back.He tries to move in with a headbutt but you kick him backwards, knocking his head against the wall.;You kick him and he whimpers. Blood splashes on your face.
Your elbow collides with his forehead. Mierda, mierda.;You hit him with a punch that splits his lip open. Blood drools over his teeth and down his chin.;He stumbles as he moves in, and you drop your fists against his head, knocking him back down again.;In a flash you have him by the throat with one hand, thrashing his ears with the other. Spittle flies out of his mouth.
You rush forward and pin him against the wall, pummeling his stomach. You can feel the wind leave his lungs.;He sidesteps one punch, but the second one catches him off guard. He grabs the wall for support to stop himself from falling.;You box him twice in the stomach. He falls backward, coughing.;You smash his jaw. A tooth comes loose.
You punch him and stumble while recovering.;You hit him in the groin. He gasps in pain and holds his stomach.;You grab his head and smash it against the wall. It leave him dizzy and you out of breath.;You swing and the sounds stop. His breathing slows.
