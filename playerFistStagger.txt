;You push him to the ground. He falls on his arms and whips to face you.;You dash in and hook his nose. You feel a satisfying crunch.;You strike him in the chest. He gasps for air.;You kick him and he whimpers.^Blood trails off your boot.;Your elbow collides with his forehead.;You throw a punch that spits his lip open.^Blood drools over his teeth and down his chin.;He kicks back with his feet, but you drop your fists^on his head, knocking him back down again.;You kick him in the stomach. He's gasping for air.;You smash his jaw.;You swing and the sounds stop as his breathing slows.
